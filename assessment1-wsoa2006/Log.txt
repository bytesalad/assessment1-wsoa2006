For the gauges, one gauge could zoom the scene and the other can re-arrange the objects to form a clear path for the space ship.

Experimentation session 1:
>> The Interaction_Manager_Movement has a final and initial value for the position of the game object being changed on screen. (new script)
>> One can now give a default value to the Interaction_Manager_GaugeInput script so that the slider doesn't default to zero if needed.
>> The Interaction_Manager_GaugeLock script checks if the gauge is in the correct position and "does something".

>> Only when the objects are in the correct location can the spaceship move through the system.
